        <h2 style="color:blue;">Animal Cells</h2>
    <p>Animal cells are <b>eukaryotic</b> cells, or cells with a membrane-bound nucleus. Unlike <b>prokaryotic</b> cells, DNA in animal cells is housed within the nucleus. In addition to having a nucleus, animal cells also contain other membrane-bound organelles, or tiny cellular structures, that carry out specific functions necessary for normal cellular operation. <b>Organelles</b> have a wide range of responsibilities that include everything from producing hormones and enzymes to providing energy for animal cells.</p>
     <h2 style="color:blue;">Animal Cells Organelles</h2>
    <p>The following are examples of structures and organelles that can be found in typical animal cells:<br />
    <br /><b>Cell (Plasma) Membrane </b>- thin, semi-permeable membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosing its contents.<br />
    <b>Centrioles </b> - cylindrical structures that organize the assembly of microtubules during cell division.<br />
    <b>Cilia and flagella </b>- specialized groupings of microtubules that protrude from some cells and aid in cellular locomotion.<br />
    <b>Cytoplasm</b> - gel-like substance within the cell.<br />
    <b>Cytoskeleton</b> - network of fibers throughout the cell's cytoplasm that gives the cell support and helps to maintain its shape.<br />
    <b>Endoplasmic Reticulum</b> - extensive network of membranes composed of both regions with ribosomes (rough ER) and regions without ribosomes (smooth ER).<br />
    <b>Golgi Complex</b> - also called the Golgi apparatus, this structure is responsible for manufacturing, storing and shipping certain cellular products.<br />
    <b>Lysosomes</b> - sacs of enzymes that digest cellular macromolecules such as nucleic acids.<br />
    <b>Microtubules</b> - hollow rods that function primarily to help support and shape the cell.<br />
    <b>Mitochondria</b> - cell components that generate energy for the cell and are the sites of cellular respiration.<br />
    <b>Nucleus</b> - membrane bound structure that contains the cell's hereditary information.<br />
    <b>Nucleolus</b> - structure within the nucleus that helps in the synthesis of ribosomes.<br />
    <b>Nucleopore</b> - tiny hole within the nuclear membrane that allows nucleic acids and proteins to move into and out of the nucleus.<br />
    <b>Peroxisomes</b> - enzyme containing structures that help to detoxify alcohol, form bile acid, and break down fats.<br />
    <b>Ribosomes</b> - consisting of RNA and proteins, ribosomes are responsible for protein assembly.</p>

        <h2 style="color:brown;">Animal cells vs Plant Cells</h2>
        <p>Animal cells and plant cells are similar in that they are both eukaryotic cells and have similar organelles. Animal cells are generally smaller than plant cells. While animal cells come in various sizes and tend to have irregular shapes, plant cells are more similar in size and are typically rectangular or cube shaped. A plant cell also contains structures not found in an animal cell. Some of these include a cell wall, a large vacuole, and plastids. Plastids, such as chloroplasts, assist in storing and harvesting needed substances for the plant. Animal cells also contain structures such as centrioles, lysosomes, cilia, and flagella that are not typically found in plant cells.</p>

          <h2 style="color:green;">Plant Cells Organelles</h2>
        <p>The following are examples of structures and organelles that can be found in typical plant cells:<br /><br />

    <b>Cell (Plasma) Membrane</b> - a thin, semi-permeable membrane that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosing its contents.<br />
   <b> Cell Wall</b> - outer covering of the cell that protects the plant cell and gives it shape.<br />

    <b>Chloroplast</b> - the sites of photosynthesis in a plant cell. They contain chlorophyll, a green pigment that absorbs energy from sunlight.<br />
    <b>Cytoplasm</b> - gel-like substance within the cell membrane containing water, enzymes, salts, organelles, and various organic molecules.<br />
    <b>Cytoskeleton</b> - a network of fibers throughout the cytoplasm that helps the cell maintain its shape and gives support to the cell.<br />
    <b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)</b> - extensive network of membranes composed of both regions with ribosomes (rough ER) and regions without ribosomes (smooth ER).<br />

    <b>Peroxisomes</b> - tiny structures bound by a single membrane that contain enzymes that produce hydrogen peroxide as a by-product. These structures are involved in plant processes such as photorespiration.<br />
    <b>Plasmodesmata</b> - pores or channels between plant cell walls that allow molecules and communication signals to pass between individual plant cells.<br />
    <b>Ribosomes</b> - consisting of RNA and proteins, ribosomes are responsible for protein assembly.<br />
    <b>Vacuole</b> - structure in a plant cell that provides support and participates in a variety of cellular functions including storage, detoxification, protection, and growth. When a plant cell matures, it typically contains one large liquid-filled vacuole.</p>
